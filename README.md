# React+Redux starter app

Starter application/kit containing the minimum set of frameworks/libraries/technologies to start working with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Motivation

Sometimes we've found ourselves doing the simplest setup for a particular framework/language, specially in the JavaScript world where these days you have tons of good libraries to help you out.

What do we usually look for? If we are talking about JavaScript then a testing framework, a linting tool and a packaging/building well-known stablished process.

Setting up all these things might take some time so it makes sense to prepare something solid and reuse it. There are a lot of awesome boilerplate/templates out there. Unfortunately most of them contains a fair amount of stuff that I don't use or need.

The idea behind this _starter app/kit_ is that you only have the minimum to start developing an application with React and Redux, testing, linting, packaging/building included. There is not a backend dependency. There is not a database to set up. And there is not a single CSS framework applied. You're completely free.
